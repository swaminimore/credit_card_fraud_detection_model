# ðŸ’³ Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a robust machine learning pipeline capable of detecting fraudulent credit card transactions in highly imbalanced datasets. By leveraging techniques like feature engineering, class balancing, and ensemble learning (Random Forest), the project aims to uncover subtle patterns that distinguish fraudulent behavior from legitimate activity, ensuring early detection, minimizing financial losses, and strengthening digital transaction security.

## How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
cd credit-card-fraud-detection
```
### 2. Install Dependencies
Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed, then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 3. Explore the Data
Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the EDA notebook:
